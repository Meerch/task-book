#Task book

##About site
On this site, you can select existing categories or add new ones. And in the selected category, create new tasks. You can make tasks complete or delete them. Above the taskbar, you can see statistics on working with tasks. Also, the user can always see the time and date on the screen. Also for interesting use, a tracking panel has been added for which days the maximum number of created and completed tasks is created. And there is also a panel with interesting facts.
